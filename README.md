# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

This application provide a basic interface that provides the user with information about the weather in a given city. The weather information is pulled from the OpenWeather.org API and displays a div with current weather information as well as a div with a 5-day forecast of that city's weather.
The user is able to search for a a city's weather using the search input form in the collapsing/expanding sidebar.

5-Day Forecast API currently pulls from 5 day / 3 hour Forecast rather than 16 day / Daily Forecast
